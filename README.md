<b>1.	How do I approach designing software?</b>

This project was the most challenging code I’ve had to build from scratch with more lines of code then previous work. I quickly learned just how important it was to stay organized and comment it a way that helped me navigate to the part I wished to work on quickly. I gained a better understanding as to how to break a project up into multiple classes and create more readable code. As I wrote code, if a function started to get lengthy or felt like it could stand independently, I separated it out into its own class. This process led to what I feel is a nice clean looking code. I believe this is a tactic that will be helpful in future projects as they will only get bigger and more cumbersome. 

<b>2.	How do I approach developing programs? </b>

Building the 3D scene through a series of milestone projects involved a lot of iteration. To become familiar with OpenGL and how rendering 3D graphics works, I started from scratch each week and reworked the formatting to fit with the new skill set I was learning. I spend a lot of time making minor adjustments not necessarily because I needed to in order to meet an assignments requirement but rather so that I could become more familiar with each of the various function’s parameters. Adjusting the lighting is a good example of this. I probably spent several hours just making minor adjustments to one parameter at a time to gain a solid grasp of what effect would occur. I did not focus on a quick streamline strategy but rather the desire to really learn and understand what was happening. 

<b>3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? </b>

My goal is to be in a career field that inspires me and challenges me. Computer Science offers me endless opportunities to continue learning and growing. I prefer a long-term career with a company but I also have to be able to grow with that company. Computer science will always be evolving and allow for that while letting me do work I truly enjoy. Computer Graphics has always been a topic of interest to me so I really enjoyed gaining knowledge on the topic. I don’t know where the future will take me careerwise but I’m hopeful I’ll have the opportunity to continue learning graphics if not for a career, then on the side for personal growth.
